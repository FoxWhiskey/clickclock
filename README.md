 A slave clock implementation for ESP8266 by Bernhard Damian 2023.

## What is a slave clock?
Slave clocks are time pieces with a simple electrical clockwork to indicate the current time based on electrical impulses generated by an external timing circuit. The timing circuit is usally capable of driving several clocks connected in parallel. That way, time pieces can show the exact time, without the need of a time synchronising mechanism.
Most clocks in public places (train stations, streets, parks, squares) are implemented based on this concept.
## How to trigger a slave clockwork?
For a slave clockwork to turn its hands (or flip a digit platelet), a simple electrical pulse is needed, that changes its polarity each duty cycle. Most clockworks demand a 24V DC pulse with a duty cycle of 300ms - sometimes longer, sometimes shorter, depending on the particular clockwork.  12V variants are also available, but less common.
## What hardware is needed?
* any ESP8266 based microcontroller, eg. the [LOLIN D1 mini][1]
* a driver circuit to provide the required 12V/24V pulses. Any stepper motor interface will do. I used the [IDUINO DEBO DRV3][2] based on the (in?)famous L298N. Unfortunately this board has a design flaw and cannot be operated at voltages greater than 18V (although stated so). See [tech note](#tech-notes) below.
* a slave clock, based on 24V or 12V
## What are the features of `clickclock`
* `clickclock` fetches the actual time over NTP and Wifi and sets the clockwork  hands accordingly
* electrical impulses for the clockwork drive are generated on ESSP8266 timer1 interrupts.
* the minute-based timer interrupt is synchronised to the first second of the (NTP-)minute. The minute hand is moved within the first 100ms of the minute. If the ISR is synchronised to NTP, the onboard LED begins flashing @ 0,5Hz.
* a basic mechanism to make the current hand position of the clockwork known to the software. Without knowledge of the hand position the correct time cannot be set automatically.
* _fun with clocks_ - functions to help kids reading analogue clockworks (yet to be implemented)

## Software Setup
### `NTP/wificonfig.h`
Enter WiFi-credentials and NTP-server address here
### `libClockWork/libClockWork.h`
Default pin assignments and timer interrupt relevant settings.
### `main.cpp`
* `HOUR_HAND_DEFAULT` and `MINUTE_HAND_DEFAULT`   
the intial position of the clockwork's hands at compiling time. Default value is 00:00.
* `loglevel` sets the serial loglevel to either of `{DEBUG,INFO,WARN,FATAL}`



## Hardware setup
Provided, the DEBO DRV3 developer board is used, find the default connections from the diagram below. Default pins are defined in `libClockWork.h`.   
```
BUTTON       ESP8266       DEBO DRV3    CLOCKWORK

               D1    <-->   IN1
               D2    <-->   IN2
               D5    <-->   ENA
 BUT1  <-->    D6
 BUT2  <-->    D7
                            MOTORA 1  <-->  1
                            MOTORA 2  <-->  2
               5V    <-->   5V
 BUTx  <-->    GND   <-->   GND
                            VMS (24VDC)  
```

## Software versions
### v1.0.x
The the very first version of `clickclock`.   
* The clockwork is set to NTP automatically, however the intial clock hand position has to be make known to `clickclock` by defining the initial position in `main.cpp`.   
* a couple of bugfixes, most importantly a bug introduced by [khoih-prog/ESP8266TimerInterrupt][3] due to an incomplete library documentation - see [tech note](#tech-notes) below.
* ISR-routines to get the (debounced) states of two bush buttons connected to the ESP.
### v1.1.x
* detect mismatch between system time (NTP) and indicated clockwork time. Needed at least twice a year when DST is de-/activated.
* Trigger different functions when push buttons are pressed short or long
* `BUTN_1` sets a compensation minute.   
When the system is started, no information is available on the polarity of the last electrical pulse. When setting the clockwork to the current time, there is a 50% chance that the first pulse is sent with an unmatched polarity and the clockwork does not move the hands with the first pulse. As a consequence, the time display is set one minute late. So a manual input is required to compensate for the late time display. A compensation minute can only be set once.
## Tech Notes
1. The [IDUINO DEBO DRV3][2] is a two-channel stepper motor developer board based on the L298N H-bridge chip. The board does not only drive stepper motors, but also has the ability to convert the input voltage (5-35V) down to 5V to supply power to connected microcontroller boards. The voltage regulation circuit is based on the 78M05. While the IDUINO datasheets allow input voltages of up to 35V, the maximum input ratings of the 78M05 cannot be told clearly from the relevant datasheet and may be limited to 18V. As a matter of fact, connecting the DEBO DRV3 to an input voltage of 24V destroys the on-board 78M05 immediately. Due to pin compatibility, it is possible to replace the chip by an LM341, granting a maximum input voltage of 35V.

2. After a couple of frustrating and unexplicable system crashes I found that the library documentation of [khoih-prog/ESP8266TimerInterrupt][3] is incomplete. The [ESP8266 interrupt handling documentation][4] states, that all interrupt service routines (ISR) need to be defined with the attribute `IRAM_ATTR`. This also applies for all functions called from the ISR itself. However, all examples based on the _ISR-based Timer_ lack the `IRAM_ATTR`-attribute!  
Unfortunately the GITHUB-repository has been archived and new issues cannot be posted.

3. For the clockwork to display local time, it was necessary to extend the [PaulStoffregen/Time][5] library with daylight saving time (DST) functionality. Not to reinvent the wheel, I have taken the maths from the execellent work of Andreas Spiess  @[SensorIOT/NTPtimeESP][6]. I highly recommend his YouTube-channel.

## Why is `clickclock` a _slave clock_ implementation?
Err, well, the wording is misleading, to be honest! The software acutally implements a _mother clock_ :-).
