 A slave clock implementation for ESP8266 by Bernhard Damian 2023.

## What is a slave clock?
Slave clocks are time pieces with a simple electrical clockwork to indicate the current time based on electrical impulses generated by an external timing circuit. The timing circuit is usally able to drive several clocks connected in parallel. That way, time pieces can show the exact time, without the need of a time synchronising mechanism.
Most clocks in public places (train stations, streets, parks, squares) are implemented based on this concept.
## How to trigger a slave clockwork?
For a slave clockwork to turn its hands (or flip a digit platelet), a simple electrical pulse is needed, that changes its polarity each duty cycle. Most clockworks demand a 24V DC pulse with a duty cycle of 300ms - sometimes longer, sometimes shorter, depending on the particular clockwork.  12V variants are also available, but less common.
## What hardware is needed?

* any ESP8266 based microcontroller, eg. the [LOLIN D1 mini][1]
* a driver circuit to provide the required 12V/24V pulses. Any stepper motor interface will do. I used the [IDUINO DEBO DRV3][2] based on the (in?)famous L298N. Unfortunately this board has a design flaw and cannot be operated at voltages greater than 18V (although stated so). See [tech note](##technote) below.
* a slave clock, based on 24V or 12V
## Software versions
### v 1.0.0
This is the very first version of `clickclock`. -

## Why is `clickclock` a _slave_ implementation?
Err, well, the wording is misleading, to be honest, the software acutally implements a _mother clock_ :-).
